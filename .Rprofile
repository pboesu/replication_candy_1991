# This .Rprofile file is used to set up the renv package (https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) 
# which aims to facilitate recreating the computational environment in which the code in 
# this repository was originally run.
# renv is not a panacea for reproducibility but it can help make projects reproducible as
# it records the version of R and R packages used in a project, and provides tools for re-
# installing the declared versions of those packages in a project.
#
# The environment in which this project was originally run is also described in the README 
# file and may be reproduced by manually installing the required packages

# This sourced script will set-up renv - you can likely ignore warnings about mismatches in 
# the R version itself.
